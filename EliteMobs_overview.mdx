# Overview

EliteMobs adds tiered elite variants of normal NPCs. Elites spawn with boosted health and damage, tiered nameplates, and gear. Higher tiers are rarer and stronger.

## Tier System

Elite tiers are 1 through 5. Spawn weights define how common each tier is. Base chances live in `main.yml`:

```yaml
Spawning:
  spawnChancePerTier:
    - 0.46
    - 0.28
    - 0.16
    - 0.08
    - 0.04
```

You can override those per environment to create high-tier zones.

## Power Scaling

Elites scale health and damage by tier:

```yaml
Health:
  healthMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0.1
    - 0.5
    - 1.1
    - 1.8
    - 2.6

Damage:
  mobDamageMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0.6
    - 1.1
    - 1.6
    - 2.1
    - 2.6
```

## Gear And Loot

Elites can equip tier-appropriate gear and drop rarer materials. Gear catalogs and rarity rules are in `catalogs.yml`. Loot rules are in `drops.yml`.

## Abilities And Effects

Abilities (like `charge_leap` and `heal_potion`) and effects (like projectile resistance) are configured in `abilities.yml` and `effects.yml`.

## Where To Start

If you want to tune difficulty, start with:
- `main.yml` for tier chances and scaling
- `visuals.yml` for nameplates
- `drops.yml` for rewards
