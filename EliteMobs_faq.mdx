# FAQ

## Why did my YAML file revert or change?

EliteMobs reconciles configs on boot. Defaults are the source of truth and missing keys are re-added automatically. Keep your edits minimal and avoid deleting sections.

## How do I make elites rarer?

Lower the values in `Spawning.spawnChancePerTier` in `main.yml`, or disable specific environments in `environmentTierSpawns`.

## How do I disable elites in a zone?

Set `enabled: false` for that environment in `main.yml` under `environmentTierSpawns`.

## How do I change elite names?

Use `visuals.yml` under `Nameplates.tierPrefixesByFamily` and `nameplatePrefixPerTier`.

## How do I prevent an NPC from becoming elite?

Add a rule in `mobs.yml` and set `enabled: false`, or exclude it using `matchExcludes`.

## Where are templates and assets stored?

Generated templates live under `Server/` in the EliteMobs mod folder, including interactions, effects, and audio.
