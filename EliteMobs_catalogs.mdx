# Gear Catalogs

Catalogs live in `catalogs.yml`.

## Armor Catalog

- `armorMaterials` lists available material folders
- `armorPiecesToEquipPerTier` defines how many armor pieces elites equip per tier

```yaml
Gear:
  armorPiecesToEquipPerTier:
    - 0
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
    - 4
```

## Weapon Catalog

`weaponCatalog` is the full list of allowed weapon IDs.

## Rarity Rules

Weapon and armor rarity is derived from substring matching:

```yaml
Gear:
  weaponRarityRulesContains:
    copper: "common"
    iron: "uncommon"
    thorium: "rare"
    adamantite: "epic"
```

## Tier Rarity Weights

```yaml
Gear:
  tierAllowedRarities:
    - ["common"]
    - ["uncommon"]
    - ["rare"]
    - ["epic"]
    - ["epic", "legendary"]
```

These lists determine which rarities are allowed per tier and how likely each is to appear.
