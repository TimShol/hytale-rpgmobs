# Mob Rules

Mob rules are in `mobs.yml` under `Spawning.rules`. The first matching rule wins.

## Basic Rule Fields

- `enabled` toggle for the rule
- `matchExact` list of NPC ids to match
- `matchStartsWith` and `matchContains` for fuzzy matching
- `matchExcludes` for disallowing ids

## Weapon Overrides

You can override weapons per tier and gate by weapon id fragments:

```yaml
Goblin_Duke:
  enabled: true
  matchExact: ["Goblin_Duke"]
  enableWeaponOverrideForTier: [true, true, true, true, true]
  weaponOverrideMode: ALWAYS
  weaponIdMustContain: ["club"]
```

`weaponOverrideMode` supports modes like `ALWAYS`, `ONLY_IF_EMPTY`, or `NONE`.

## Example: Excluding Ranged Weapons

```yaml
Goblin_Hermit:
  enabled: true
  matchExact: ["Goblin_Hermit"]
  weaponOverrideMode: ALWAYS
  weaponIdMustNotContain: ["shortbow", "crossbow", "staff", "pickaxe", "bomb", "kunai", "blunderbuss", "spellbook"]
```

## Tips

- Use `matchExact` for precision, `matchContains` for broad families.
- Keep per-tier overrides consistent with your loot and catalog rules.
