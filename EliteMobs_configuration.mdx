# Configuration

EliteMobs is configured through these YAML files. Defaults live in code and YAML overrides are applied on boot. Missing keys are re-added automatically.

## File Map

- `main.yml` global systems, spawning, health and damage scaling, compatibility, gear durability, asset generator
- `mobs.yml` mob matching rules and weapon overrides
- `abilities.yml` elite abilities and their gates
- `effects.yml` tiered status effects
- `drops.yml` loot tables and extra rare drops
- `catalogs.yml` weapon and armor catalogs, rarity rules
- `consumables.yml` consumable movement and duration tuning
- `visuals.yml` model scaling and nameplates

## Schema Notes

- Arrays with 5 entries are tier-based (Tier 1 to Tier 5).
- Many sections support per-environment overrides.
- Values are read at boot and reconciled with defaults.

## Best Practice

Keep edits minimal and version-controlled. The mod will reconcile missing keys back into the file on boot, so avoid deleting sections entirely.
