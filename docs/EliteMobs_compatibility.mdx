# Compatibility

EliteMobs is designed to work with other mods. It focuses on NPC stats, abilities, gear, and visuals without replacing core systems.

## Compatibility Mods

Compatibility Mods (expandable list):
- [EliteMobs RPG Leveling Compatibility](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/elitemobs-rpgleveling-compat)

## RPG Leveling Compatibility

The EliteMobs RPG Leveling Compatibility mod integrates EliteMobs with RPG Leveling nameplates and tier progression. It can:

- Merge elite tiers into RPG Leveling nameplates
- Control prefix order and separators
- Optionally override RPG Leveling health and damage scaling

Config location for the compatibility mod:

```
%APPDATA%\Hytale\UserData\Saves\<world name>\Mods\EliteMobsRPGLevelingCompat
```

## Stacking Effects

If you use other mods that scale damage or stats, those multipliers can stack with EliteMobs tier scaling. Expect higher difficulty unless you tune EliteMobs scaling down.

## Recommended Companion Mods

- Perfect Parries is commonly paired for a more skill-focused combat experience.
