title: Consumables
description: Configuring potion and food behavior for the player.
---

`consumables.yml` defines how items consumed by players behave during combat. This mainly affects player healing items, controlling how fast players drink and how much it slows them down.

## Potion Behavior

When a player drinks a potion, they slow down and play a drinking animation. These settings control the timing and movement penalty. This is mainly done to balance the difficulty of higher tier elites. The default vanilla values felt a bit too sluggish for how paced the combat is.

```yaml
Consumables:
  byId:
    EliteMobs_Consumable_Big_Potions:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.8

    EliteMobs_Consumable_Small_Potions:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.2
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `horizontalSpeedMultiplier` | Movement speed while consuming. `0.7` means the player moves at 70% speed (30% slower). Lower values make it easier for enemies to close distance during the animation. | `0.7` |
| `consumeDuration` | Time in seconds to finish consuming the item. Longer durations give enemies more time to interrupt the heal. | `1.8` (big) / `1.2` (small) |

## Food Tiers

The default configuration also includes entries for food items used internally:

```yaml
Consumables:
  byId:
    EliteMobs_Consumable_Food_Tier1:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.0

    EliteMobs_Consumable_Food_Tier2:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.2

    EliteMobs_Consumable_Food_Tier3:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.4
```

**Tip:** If drinking or eating feels too fast, increase `consumeDuration`. If players are too fast while drinking, lower `horizontalSpeedMultiplier`.
